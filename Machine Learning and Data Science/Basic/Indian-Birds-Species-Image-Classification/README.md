# **ðŸ”´ Project Title: Bird Species Classification**

# **ðŸ”´ Goal:**
The main goal of this project is to create a deep learning model that can accurately classify different species of birds using images. Various CNN architectures are explored to achieve high classification accuracy.

# **ðŸ”´ Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project can be found at: [Indian Birds Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ichhadhari/indian-birds). It contains a collection of bird images categorized into different species, divided into training and validation sets.

# **ðŸ”´ Description:**
This project focuses on implementing and comparing various deep learning models to classify bird species from images. The goal is to determine which model performs the best in terms of accuracy and generalization.

# **ðŸ”´ What I Have Done:**
To develop the bird species classification model, the following steps were followed:

1. Data exploration and preprocessing:
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights.
   - Preprocess the images by resizing and normalizing.

2. CNN model:
   - Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification.
   - Train the CNN model on the dataset and evaluate its performance.
   - Calculate the training and validation accuracies of the CNN model.

3. Pre-trained models:
   - Implement various pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, DenseNet121) for transfer learning.
   - Fine-tune the models on the dataset and evaluate their performance.
   - Calculate the training and validation accuracies of each model.
